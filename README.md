## Use FRB DM to constrain the evolution of the fine-structure constant

* We provide the paper [Constraints on Evolutions of Fundamental Constants from Clustering of Fast Radio Burst Dispersion Measure](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adba4a), which employs the runaway dilaton model. In this model, we focus on the evolution parameter $\gamma$.

* We consider $10^5$ and $10^7$ number of FRBs. However, the results show that $10^5$ FRBs can give enough constraint.

* The reason why we can use FRB DM to constrain $\gamma$ is the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ is related to $n_e$, and FRB DM can detect it. (More details are in the above paper and my notes)

* The floder called '/galaxy' use the same power spectrm as previous work, which is 'Cosmic gwowth rate'. It can forecast the $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha}(z)$ in three different redshift 0.15, 0.45, 0.75, which are corresponding with three galaxy redshift bins. And in the *.pdf files in this floder, the label is $alpha$, which is actually $\frac{\Delta \alpha}{\alpha}(z)$, here is just a brief note.
