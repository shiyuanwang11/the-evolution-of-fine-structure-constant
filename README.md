## Use FRB DM to constrain the evolution of the fine-structure constant

* We follow the paper [A search for the fine-structure constant evolution from fast radio bursts and type Ia supernovae data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381510660_A_search_for_the_fine-structure_constant_evolution_from_fast_radio_bursts_and_type_Ia_supernovae_data), which employs the runaway dilaton model. In this model, we focus on the evolution parameter $\gamma$.

* We consider $10^5$ and $10^7$ number of FRBs.

* The reason why we can use FRB DM to constrain $\gamma$ is the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ is related to $n_e$, and FRB DM can detect it. (More details are in the above paper and my notes)
