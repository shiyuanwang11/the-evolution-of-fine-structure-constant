## Use FRB DM to constrain the evolution of the fine-structure constant

We follow the paper [A search for the fine-structure constant evolution from fast radio bursts and type Ia supernovae data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381510660_A_search_for_the_fine-structure_constant_evolution_from_fast_radio_bursts_and_type_Ia_supernovae_data), which employs the runaway dilaton model
